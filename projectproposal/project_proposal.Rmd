# Short description
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is the pigmented layer of cells in the retina of the eye that serves vital roles in the visual mechanisms.
Genetic variants that affect the RPE gene expression could lead to various ocular diseases.
By examining genetics of gene expression of cultured human fetal RPE (fRPE) cells under two different metabolic conditions, these genetic variants could be elucidated.
Hundreds of expression or splice quantitative loci (e/sQTLs) were discovered.
